# 343 Assignment2

Assignment involves specifying the behaviour for creatures in a 2D world occupied by monsters and food.
The creatures move around using energy, energy can be replenished by eating food but the creatures can 
be eaten by monsters in the world.
This was an exercise in creating a genetic algorithm where the creatures get better at avoiding monsters and eating food as the generations progress.
